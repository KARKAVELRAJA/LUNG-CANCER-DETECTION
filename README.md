# LUNG-CANCER-DETECTION

### PYTHON CODE TO DETECT LUNG CANCER USING LINEAR DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS

-----

### LINEAR DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS

- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is primarily used to reduce the number of features to a more manageable number before classification
- LDA also supports both binary and multi-class classification

-----

### WORKFLOW OF LUNG CANCER DETECTION

- Collecting the Dataset
- Pre-processing the Dataset
- Loading the LINEAR DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS Algorithm
- Training the Model using the training dataset
- Testing the Model using the testing dataset
- Performing Classification
- Calculating the Accuracy
