# LUNG-CANCER-DETECTION

### PYTHON CODE TO DETECT LUNG CANCER USING LINEAR DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS

-----

### LINEAR DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS

- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is primarily used to reduce the number of features to a more manageable number before classification
- LDA also supports both binary and multi-class classification
